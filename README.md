# Gradient Boosting Meta Tree

This repository provides an implementation of the Gradient Boosting Meta Tree (GBMT) algorithm, including experiment scripts, benchmark notebooks, and utility code for regression tasks.
Our paper is presented in IEEE MLSP 2025 (https://2025.ieeemlsp.org/en/).
Codes in this repository are based on the BayesML repository (https://github.com/bayesml/BayesML).


## Directory Structure
- `gradient_boosting_meta_tree/` : Main implementation code for GBMT, including submodules for different distributions (bernoulli, categorical, linearregression, normal) and meta tree logic
- `experiments/` : Jupyter notebooks for experiments, benchmarking, and result visualization
- `tests/` : Unit tests for core modules
- `data/` : Preprocessed datasets for regression tasks
- `results/` : Output files, figures, and error arrays generated by experiments


## Usage
- Run and modify experiment notebooks in the `experiments/` directory for benchmarking and analysis.
- Model implementations and meta tree logic are in `gradient_boosting_meta_tree/`.
- Preprocessed datasets are available in `data/regression/preprocessed_data/`.
- Results and figures are saved in `results/`.
