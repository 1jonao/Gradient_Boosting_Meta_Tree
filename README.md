# Gradient Boosting Meta Tree

This repository is based on the BayesML repository (https://github.com/bayesml/BayesML) and contains the implementation of the Gradient Boosting Meta Tree (GBMT) algorithm and related experiment code.

## Directory Structure
- `gradient_boosting_meta_tree/` : Main implementation code for GBMT
- `experiments/` : Experiment notebooks and code
- `scripts/` : Scripts for sample generation, etc.
- `tests/` : Test code

## Setup
1. Install the required Python packages:
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
2. The implementation and experiments have been tested with Python 3.10 or later.

## Usage
- Experiment notebooks are located in the `experiments/` directory.
- Model implementations are organized under `gradient_boosting_meta_tree/`.
- For sample generation, refer to `scripts/run_gen_sample.py`.
