# Gradient Boosting Meta Tree

This repository is based on the BayesML repository (https://github.com/bayesml/BayesML) and provides an implementation of the Gradient Boosting Meta Tree (GBMT) algorithm, including experiment scripts, benchmark notebooks, and utility code for regression tasks.


## Directory Structure
- `gradient_boosting_meta_tree/` : Main implementation code for GBMT, including submodules for different distributions (bernoulli, categorical, linearregression, normal) and meta tree logic
- `experiments/` : Jupyter notebooks for experiments, benchmarking, and result visualization
- `tests/` : Unit tests for core modules
- `data/` : Preprocessed datasets for regression tasks
- `results/` : Output files, figures, and error arrays generated by experiments


## Usage
- Run and modify experiment notebooks in the `experiments/` directory for benchmarking and analysis.
- Model implementations and meta tree logic are in `gradient_boosting_meta_tree/`.
- Preprocessed datasets are available in `data/regression/preprocessed_data/`.
- Results and figures are saved in `results/`.
